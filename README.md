# Introduction to Wireframing
## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating simplified, low-fidelity visual representations of a website, app, or digital interface. These sketches or digital layouts focus on the structure, layout, and placement of elements—such as menus, buttons, images, and content—without getting into detailed design or visual aesthetics.
Why is Wireframing Important?

## Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process because it:
### Clarifies Ideas
It helps designers and stakeholders visualize how information and features will be organized and how users will navigate the product.
### Saves Time and Resources
Early identification of usability issues or layout problems prevents costly changes during development.
### Facilitates Communication
Wireframes serve as a shared reference point for designers, developers, and clients, ensuring everyone is aligned before moving into high-fidelity design or coding.
### Focuses on User Experience
By stripping away colors and visuals, wireframes emphasize user flow and functionality, ensuring that usability remains the priority.
